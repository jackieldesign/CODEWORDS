Hello! Welcome to my SKO for the Code + words studio run by Andy Simionato and Karen ann Donnachie  â˜»  

Because I was too scared of Github earlier in the semester, I compiled many anythings in a [Milanote board](https://app.milanote.com/1K8HVt1SIiPR8B?p=hN70IwOtzhJ) whenever I found a helpful or cool resource. Everything there will already be included here, but the Milanote is like a version with only links, photos, and without my ramblings. If you like, you can have a look, and I hope you find something of interest :)
