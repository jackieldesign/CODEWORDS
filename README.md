# jackie learns code things

Because i was too scared of Github earlier in the semester, I compiled many anythings in a Milanote board whenever I found a helpful or cool resource. Everything there will already be included in my Github, but this is like another version where I write less and everything's in an organised chaos. [Have a looksie](https://app.milanote.com/1K8HVt1SIiPR8B?p=hN70IwOtzhJ) and I hope you find something of interest!
