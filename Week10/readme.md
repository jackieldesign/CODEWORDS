# WEEK 10 — PRESENTATIONS, TYPOGRAPHY AND NEXT STEPS

Have been trying to figure out how to get one word to appear at a time each oscillation. Been doing this for a week, not sure why I'm taking so long because I think this should have a simple solution!

I stripped the whole sketch back so I could focus on this one goal.

I added a class, and pushed them from an array according to the X position of the nose, so I think that's a step in the right direction. They do appear one at a time! However, they appear very quickly and keep looping...

SO! I need to find out how to make the loop only happen once each time. I tried using a boolean variable, but that resulted in only the first word appearing. I also tried noLoop(); but this freezes the entire draw function.

Other things I changed:

- I enforced the video size so it would be the same for everyone's devices.
- Made some more elements responsive to the window size.
- Added windowResize function to auto-resize when the window size is changed.


### Update

I got one full string to appear at the very start, but it won't continue...

### Myron Krueger — Early Interactivity

Myron Krueger is one of the first computer artists to create digital interactive works. I first found his work "Videoplace" who originally studied computer science.

### Red Burns — Godmother of Silicon Valley

In several of Dan Shiffman's videos, he mentioned Red Burns and the quote that "She knew that technology was a means to an end. And that end is people." I think this philosophy is one that the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) school she founded was built around. It's an integral focus to the field of computer arts, and I'd argue it's essential to remember in any field requiring technology.

I read an [article about Red Burns](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/pearls-wisdom-tech-world-red-burns-godmother-silicon-alley/311722/)] from the Atlantic in 2013. She's not only a historical leader in tech, but has also provided the world with some beautiful pieces of advice.

Funnily enough, she states an opinion that echoes Andy, saying that the computer is just a tool, like a pen. Except Andy was talking about Adobe :')

Thinking about technology in a way that considers the world and its needs is so crucial. We can get carried away with the glamour of it - but focusing on becoming people rather than technicians is something we should really strive for.
