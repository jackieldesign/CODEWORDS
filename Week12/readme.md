### Artist Statement

>When words move, they think. In R. A Lanham’s “What’s Next for Text”, we follow the changes that text has undergone throughout history, and imagine its future. ‘Thinking’, moving alphabets are described in this excerpt as what text has always striven to be, returning to the true underlying constant of change and movement.
> 
>‘OSCILLATE’ is an interactive reading experience that moves you, whilst you simultaneously move the experience. Your physical oscillation flings the camera across the screen, but more importantly, reveals the oscillating words. This work is informed and influenced by the interactive works of Myron Krueger and Zach Lieberman, as to offer that powerful participatory agency, whilst transforming it into an immersive reading experience. 
> 
>Using the ML5.js library inside Processing (made by Casey Reas & Ben Fry), I was able to use Posenet to access pose-tracking. The pose is mapped onto the video position, whilst also acting as a determinant for which side the words appear. To visualise the transition between print and digital, I’ve used the pixelated serif typeface Redaction by Titus Kaphar and Reginald Dwayne Betts.
>
>The body in collaboration with the text unlocks a wonderful co-existence and oscillation between physical and virtual spaces. That’s what’s next for text.
