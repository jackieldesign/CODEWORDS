### Artist Statement

>When words move, they think. In R. A Lanham’s “What’s Next for Text”, we follow the changes that text has undergone throughout history, and imagine its future. ‘Thinking’, moving alphabets are described in this excerpt as what text has always striven to be, returning to the true underlying constant of change and movement.
> 
>‘OSCILLATE’ is an interactive reading experience that moves you, whilst you simultaneously move the experience. Your physical oscillation flings the camera across the screen, but more importantly, reveals the oscillating words. This work is informed and influenced by the interactive works of Myron Krueger and Zach Lieberman, as to offer that powerful participatory agency, whilst transforming it into an immersive reading experience. 
> 
>Using the ML5.js library inside Processing (made by Casey Reas & Ben Fry), I was able to use Posenet to access pose-tracking. The pose is mapped onto the video position, whilst also acting as a determinant for which side the words appear. To visualise the transition between print and digital, I’ve used the pixelated serif typeface Redaction by Titus Kaphar and Reginald Dwayne Betts.
>
>The body in collaboration with the text unlocks a wonderful co-existence and oscillation between physical and virtual spaces. That’s what’s next for text.

>Instructions: Please activate your webcam :)

### Au revoir!

I knew before I chose this studio that I was interested in learning code, especially as Andy had teased [Tiger Dingsun's Reading Machines](https://tdingsun.github.io/reading-machines/) in last semester's AR studio that I absolutely fell in love with. I didn't know however, that I would end up being so fascinated by it that I would plan on using and continuing to learn it for the rest of my life.

It is also an intriguing experience to be learning code in conjunction with typgraphy and reading. As a reader who struggled to even consider an audiobook as 'real reading', this tutorial has really widened my perspective on what reading really means, and how powerful it is when it isn't limited to one specific physical form. Though the tangible experience of a book is beautiful and nostalgic, there are other ways to experience reading that are interactive, immersive, unexpected or reflexive. And that's what e-literature has the power to be. 

This studio, with the guidance of Andy and Karen, has fostered a generous and genuinely supportive community of students. Even when online, it's funny how much I learnt from other students, with open sharing of code, asking for help and trying to help others. To see how much everyone has progressed in the span of a semester is unbelievable. I do hate to admit this, but it's easy to feel competitive or envious in other classes, and the good news is that in this environment, I didn't feel a hint of that. Everyone was on a different trajectory, doing things that everyone else didn't know how to do, coming up with ideas that I audibly 'wow'ed at every time (my sister can testify to this).

It's an strange dissonance that I feel, as someone who is known mostly for illustration and graphic design. It's made me question what the label of 'illustration' really encompasses, and in what ways I can implement code into my practice. I don't want to feel torn between the two fields, but rather, synthesize them to create something interesting. On the other hand, code seems to complement graphic design perfectly, in a way that adds interactive or visual flair that distinguishes it from others. 

I'm itching to continue using code in future works. For my Public Art Projects elective, I knew I had to try incorporate creative coding into my proposal for an artwork at next year's orientation, again with pose detection, possibly expanding towards using the Kinect camera that uses an infrared camera to sense depth/distance. I'm really excited to bring to life other projects I have in mind. After working with Bowen Street Press for a few book designs, I have seedlings of ideas to work with writers in some way to show their work in a digital spaces, or perhaps make a electronic zine collaboration with other creative coders!

Thank you Andy and Karen, for creating such a warm, understanding and generous environment. It's an emotional rollercoaster every time I open Processing, but this studio has been a true highlight, and a treasure trove of discoveries. Thanks so much, and see you guys later! :)
